In this module we test that the opening_hours block for
a POI located in a different timezone (Moscow) contains
the correct information.

For each test we freeze time at different datetimes and
for each we create a fake different OpeningHourBlock from
a raw json extracted from a POI located in Moscow city.

TODO: a test that checks that opening hours can now span
over midnight (branch 'new-parsing' of the repo)
